Please make use of Typescript and Prettier.js when editing code so as to keep things consistent.

Prettier settings include these options:
--trailing-comma=es5

I'd like to keep this library as simple and concise as possible, so any changes will need to keep with the same ethos.

Please open up an issue beforehand to discuss the problem / feature you'd like to add to the libary so we can figure out the best way forward together.
